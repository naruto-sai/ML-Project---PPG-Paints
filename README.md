# ML-Project---PPG-Paints
Predicting Paint properties and popularity using colour models 


In the Regression task, the objective is to train models to predict the important paint property, response , as a function of the color model INPUTS

In the Classification task Train models to classify if the paint is among the popular paint products sold by PPG based just on color model INPUTS. The popularity is provided as BINARY variable, outcome , in the training set.

Popular paints are denoted as outcome = 1 while less popular paints are denoted as outcome = 0. The EVENT is thus outcome = 1 and the NON EVENT is outcome = 0


Project consists of 4 main areas

### Part i: Exploration

Dissect the data to observe trends.

### Part ii: Regression

Fit non Bayesian and Bayesian linear models. Train, tune, and assess performance of simple and complex models with resampling.

### Part iii: Classification

Fit non Bayesian and Bayesian generalized linear models. Train, tune, and assess performance of simple and complex models with resampling.

### Part iv: Interpretation

Identify the best models, most important features, and the hardest to predict paints for the regression and classification tasks. This is not shared due to the proprietary information.
